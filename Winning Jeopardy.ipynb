    "[Jeopardy](https://www.jeopardy.com/) is a popular TV show in the US where participants answer questions to win money. In this project, we will work with a dataset of Jeopardy questions to look for patterns to improve the chances of winning.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those familiar with the show, the contestant usually has to give the answer in the form of a question while the actual question is phrased as an answer. An example question could be, \"This famous white beagle is from the Peanuts series.\" The contestant would be required to answer with a question such as, \"Who is Snoopy?\" While the format of Jeopardy's questions and answers are different than most quiz shows, this dataset lists questions and answers in the typical format where a contestant is asked a question and provides an answer."
